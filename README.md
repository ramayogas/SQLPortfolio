###🛢️ SQL Portfolio

Hi, I’m Yogas — a Data Analyst with a UX mindset and strong foundations in SQL and Python. 
I specialize in transforming raw, messy datasets into structured, reliable insights that support data-driven decision-making. My background in UX design allows me to approach data from a human-centered perspective, ensuring insights are not only technically sound, but also meaningful and actionable.
Across my projects, I focus on data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and clear reporting using SQL, Python (Pandas), Excel, and visualization tools.

## About This Repository
This repository focuses on SQL-based data cleaning, transformation, and structured reporting.
Projects demonstrate:
- Cleaning and standardizing inconsistent text fields
- Handling edge cases in real-world datasets
- Creating structured tables ready for analysis
- Writing efficient and readable SQL queries
- Building data outputs suitable for reporting and business use

The goal is to showcase practical SQL skills applied to real-world data scenarios.
